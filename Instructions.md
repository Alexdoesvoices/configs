# **Instructions**

1. Install GIT from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

    * Once installed make sure to configure your account.

    * Open a terminal and I recomend changing directory to downloads, then run:


        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Alexdoesvoices/configs 
        ```


2. Install the Chocolatey Package Manager from: https://community.chocolatey.org/
    * This will be required to run the **choco.ps1** installation script later.
