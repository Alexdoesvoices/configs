This is a online repistory with my config files for certain applications, along with package manger install scripts and other utility/installation scripts of my making.

## **Getting Started**

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing, you can use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Alexdoesvoices/configs 
```


## **Side Note**
Some of these configs may have file paths that do not exist on your computer.
